### [Advanced React Patterns](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/advanced-react-patterns/)

Discover how to simplify your large React applications with advanced component
patterns! In this course, Kent C. Dodds shows how to separate component logic,
state and display properties to make your components more flexible and usable
across large React applications. You’ll learn patterns like Compound Components,
Render Props, Prop Getters, Controlled Props, and how to take advantage of
React’s new Context API to share state throughout the application. This course
is for developers who have experience building React applications and desire to
scale their applications with components that are both simpler and more
flexible!

### [Testing React Applications](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/)

Learn to catch errors before they reach the end user with automated tests! Write
maintainable tests for your React applications using the popular Jest testing
framework. You’ll also see how much of your code is covered in tests, test your
React components with the react-testing library and write end-to-end tests with
Cypress and the cypress-testing library. Join Kent and learn how to test your
code in-depth. This course is for developers who want to gain confidence in
shipping bug-free React applications to production!
