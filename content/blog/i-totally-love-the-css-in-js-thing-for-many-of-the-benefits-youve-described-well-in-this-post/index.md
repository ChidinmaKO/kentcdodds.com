I totally love the CSS in JS thing for many of the benefits you’ve described
well in this post. Have you given a look at
[aphrodite](http://npm.im/aphrodite)? It removes several of the “bad” items that
you’ve listed. I prefer it over
[Radium](https://www.briefs.fm/3-minutes-with-kent/28),
[CSS modules](https://www.briefs.fm/3-minutes-with-kent/21), and
[BEM](https://www.briefs.fm/3-minutes-with-kent/23) for some of the “bad”
reasons you expressed (those links are to 3 minute podcasts of me explaining my
preference).

I recommend you give it a look. I actually use aphrodite on
[JavaScriptAir.com](https://javascriptair.com) which would actually fail your
“Does your DOM change a lot in response to user interaction?” test, but I still
think it’s suprior to CSS :-)

Anyway, thanks for the post!
