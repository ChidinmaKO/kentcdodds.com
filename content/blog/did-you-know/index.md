You can clap more than once for a medium post. No I‚Äôm serious. In fact, _you can
clap up to 50 times!_ And you don‚Äôt even have to tap/click on it 50 times, _you
can just press and hold_ on the clap icon and it‚Äôll just keep clapping up to 50.

Like this one time, I was really impressed by
[a blog post](https://cdb.reacttraining.com/react-inline-functions-and-performance-bdff784f5578)
from my friend [Ryan Florence](https://medium.com/u/162352c45b6e), **so I just
clapped 50 times üëè** It was super satisfying, and
[I think he appreciated it](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/916392628240793602).
You can even keep pressing on the clap icon after 50 and even though it wont
keep counting up your claps, it still has that cool animation which is
satisfying in a more personal way.

Just watch:

So the next time you encounter a Medium post that you like especially well, give
it a few more claps. And **if this blog post taught you anything** you didn‚Äôt
know already, then give it 50 claps. I think you‚Äôll like it.
