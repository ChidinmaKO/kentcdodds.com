I was intrigued by [the slides](https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js)
from [Vjeux](https://twitter.com/vjeux) entitled “React: CSS in JS” (which is
very good stuff and I would encourage you to read through it). I decided to see
what it would look like to create something similar with Angular. turns out it’s
not that bad and it’s actually kind of refreshing. I think I’ll keep looking
into this…

Here’s a demo that I built when experimenting with the concept:

**AngularJS: CSS in JS**[  
\_Inspired by Vjeux…\_jsbin.com](http://jsbin.com/jocewu/edit 'http://jsbin.com/jocewu/edit')[](http://jsbin.com/jocewu/edit)

So there’s definitely room for additional abstractions here to make it easier to
manage, but I can see some serious potential with this approach and will
definitely investigate it further (perhaps even release a library with the
necessary abstractions). It’s actually sort of delightful to write styles this
way…

What are your thoughts on this? In my mind, I see ReactJS personified as a ninja
with a sword called JavaScript and he’s whacking away at HTML and CSS (not as
cool ninjas apparently) because he doesn’t need them anymore. Maybe that’s a
little strong for what is actually going on, but I think the imagery is kind of
cool.
