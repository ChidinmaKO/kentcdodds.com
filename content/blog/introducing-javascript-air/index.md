I‚Äôm pleased to announce [JavaScript Air](http://javascriptair.com)! This is a
live video broadcast podcast all about JavaScript and the web and the first
episode,
‚Äú[The past, present, and future of JavaScript](https://plus.google.com/events/c39cuc7ueppus41ajobpr9qt6cg),‚Äù
will be with [BrendanEich](https://medium.com/u/bcf2eaa79e8c). I couldn‚Äôt be
more stoked to have the original creator of JavaScript on for the first episode
of this new show.

Add the event to your calendar by RSVPing to
[the Google+ event](http://bit.ly/js-air-first).

relating to the JavaScript and the web. Guest and topic

#### Brief History

A year ago [Todd Motto](https://twitter.com/toddmotto) and I started
[Angular Air](https://twitter.com/AngularAir). It‚Äôs been an awesome experience.
I recently decided that I could do more for the community by focusing more on
JavaScript. So I handed off management and ownership of Angular Air to
[Angular Class](https://angularclass.com/) and hosting to
[Jeff Whelpley](https://medium.com/u/d1d326dd6a28) and I‚Äôll be focusing my
attention on JavaScript Air.

You can see the announcement in my last episode of Angular Air:
‚Äú[The Importance of Learning JavaScript](https://youtu.be/hWmNDlLrCI0)‚Äù with
[Kyle](https://medium.com/u/5dccb9bb4625) (the whole episode was awesome, but if
you just want to see the announcement, it was
[at the end](https://youtu.be/hWmNDlLrCI0?t=1h1m57s)).

#### Thanks!

I want to say thanks to everyone who‚Äôs supported me with Angular Air and
encouraged me to keep this going. I‚Äôm looking forward to helping provide the
community with high quality content to keep us all current and relevant in this
exciting fast-paced industry! See you around!
