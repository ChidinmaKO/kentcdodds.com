Your entire application should be accessible. I’m not going to go into why.
There are plenty of articles describing the wins. This is to describe one thing
that I did where I work that appeased our designer, but maintained
accessibility.

I’m talking about that nice blue outline browsers give you when an element
receives focus.

This is great for people who are restricted to the keyboard or have difficulties
seeing, but designers hate it. “It doesn’t really match our style.”
