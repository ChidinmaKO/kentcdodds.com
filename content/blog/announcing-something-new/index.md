### [Testing Practices and Principles](https://workshop.me/2018-03-testing/?a=kent)

**Mar 22nd, 2018** in San Francisco, CA

The goal of a test is to increase your confidence that the subject of your test
is functioning the way it should be. Not all tests provide the same level of
confidence (some provide very little confidence at all). If you’re not doing
things correctly, you could be wasting your time and giving yourself a false
sense of security (even worse than having no tests at all).
