I recently tweeted out what’s probably one of the best examples of a “privilege
pity party” ever:

First off, I should probably give a little bit of context around this tweet.
Here’s some hard data that I hadn’t considered when I tweeted this:

- I’ve gone to 10 conferences this year (and have 2 more scheduled)
- Those conferences took about 30 days away from work
- I’ve taken 10 days of non-conference Personal Time Off (PTO)
- My employer (PayPal) continued to pay my salary during the time I was away at
  those conferences.
- That time amounts to about 1 day per week that I was away from work and still
  getting paid for it. Wow.

I’m not a in a Developer Relations position or anything. I just really like
going to conferences and get invited to speak quite a bit. I’m at the beginning
of my career and nothing strokes my ego quite like getting invited to speak at a
conference. So I have just submitted and accepted invitations to do so.

But here’s the deal. I work on a product team that I love. We’re building
something that enables people to send money to their family and friends all over
the world. It’s awesome. My manager and team have been supportive of me
attending conferences. But they’ve had to pick up the slack when I’ve been gone
having fun at a conference (probably more than I realized). So it totally makes
sense that my boss would ask me to cut back a little bit. It doesn’t make sense
that I’d raise a stink about it on Twitter. That’s not excusable.

The purpose of this post is for me to apologize for being such a cry-baby on
Twitter and apologize to my team for taking advantage of their kindness and not
being as available as I should have. That’s definitely a change that needs to
happen and I’m excited to start contributing more.

Also, I want to make it clear that PayPal is a fantastic place to work. I
totally love it here. They treat employees really well and have given me a lot
of opportunities to grow and improve my skills. **_If you’re looking for an
amazing place to work and make a great impact on the world, we’re hiring!_**
