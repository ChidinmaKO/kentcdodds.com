I’m excited to be speaking in March at the O’Reilly Fluent Conference this year
in San Francisco. I’m extremely excited about my talk topic “**The First Pull
Request**”. You can read the outline of the topic [here](http://kcd.im/UtzbQ).

#### Come to Fluent Conf

Here are some of the reasons I think you should come to Fluent Conf this year.

- To see my talk: “The First Pull Request” which will inspire you whether you’re
  new to Open Source or a long time veteran and project(s) maintainer!
- To meet me! I love meeting people. Come to the conference and lets talk shop,
  family, life, whatever. I want to get to know **you**!
- Fluent Conf is a premier web conference. Going to this conference will really
  make a difference on your year in web dev because of the top quality speakers
  and topics going on at the conference.

#### JavaScript Air Live and on-site!

JavaScript Air will be doing a show live at the conference
([jsair.io/fluent-conf](http://jsair.io/fluent-conf))! We’re really looking
forward to this and several of the [panelists](http://panel.jsair.io) will be
there 😀❗️

#### 20% off!

As a speaker, I was given a 20% off discount code for O’Reilly Fluent Conf 2016.
