## Why semver ranges are literally the¬†worst‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôve all experienced it:

> ‚ÄúBut it works on my machine!‚Äù

> ‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs not working on mine or the build server‚Ä¶‚Äù

> ‚ÄúWhat on earth!?‚Äù

> ‚ÄúTry \$ rm -rf node_modules && npm i‚Äù

> ‚ÄúNo! What if it breaks on mine and then I can‚Äôt get any work done!?!¬†‚Ä¶ Yup‚Ä¶
> Broken on mine now too‚Ä¶‚Äù üò≠

Most likely someone in the world published a breaking change to one of your
dependencies. So if you‚Äôre like me, you now have to go through all of your 100+
npm dependencies and try to figure out which one it was. To make it even more
fun, you also need to figure out how to fix the problem **and fast** because the
release is in an hour‚Ä¶

### How did this¬†happen?

It‚Äôs simple. It‚Äôs all about how
[Semantic Versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning)
([more info](http://semver.org/)) and
[version ranges](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver) work. In your package.json
(where you declare your dependencies), you specify versions for your
dependencies. In those version values, you have a bit of control over the range
of version you‚Äôll accept. You can either be super loose (saying you‚Äôll accept
the latest released version), super strict (saying you‚Äôll only accept a specific
version), or anywhere in between. **My goal in this post is to convince you that
you should almost always use specific versions.**

A common way to install packages in your project is to do:

```
npm install lodash --save
```

This will both install the package in your node_modules directory as well as
save this to your package.json file (if present):

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^3.10.1"
  }
}
```

The real problem is the caret character there. That says: install this version
or anything above 3.10.1 but below 4.0.0.

The cool thing about this is that when the lodash team pushes out updates to
lodash, we get the updates for free! Without having to update anything at all!
How cool is that!?

Well, it‚Äôs cool for libraries from the lodash core team. They‚Äôre pretty good
about avoiding hiccups in releases. However, there are other project maintainers
that aren‚Äôt quite as into semver (they‚Äôre in the
[Sentimental Versioning](http://sentimentalversioning.org/) camp). And even more
common is the fact that we‚Äôre all humans and can make mistakes when releasing
bug fixes or new features. So when a new version gets pushed out as a patch
change (the last number), if it has a bug in it, things break.

The other thing that makes this bad is by doing this you, your build server, and
your co-worker could be working with completely different node_module versions
installed. Most of the time this isn‚Äôt a problem. But whenever it becomes a
problem, it‚Äôs always at the worst time.
